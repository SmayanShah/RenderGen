âœ… That's it! Super clean!

# ðŸ›  3. `.gitkeep` (optional)

- Create an **empty** file called `.gitkeep` inside folders **if any folder is empty** (for example if you had an empty `static/` or `uploads/` folder)
- In your case **no need** right now since `backend/` has real `.py` files.

âœ… **Skip for now.**
